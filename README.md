# UmbrellaWeather-Android

 The local weather DB is parsed to let you know if it rains on that day in one hour.
For example, when you wake up in the morning, you can receive a reminder to see if it rains today.
I made it to think about when I was suddenly embarrassed by rain because I had no habit of checking the weather through newspaper, news or weather app.
