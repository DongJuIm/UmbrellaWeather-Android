# UmbrellaWeather-Android

 This application tells you if it rains on that day in a certain area.
For example, when you wake up in the morning, you can receive a reminder to see if it rains today.
I made it to think about when I was suddenly embarrassed by rain because I had no habit of checking the weather through newspaper, news or weather app.

<!WeatherDB couldn't pick and import regions dynamically, so it was created by parsing weather URLs from any one region!>
